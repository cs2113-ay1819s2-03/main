== Introduction

NoteNote (NN) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing multiple projects*. More importantly, NN is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, NN can get your project management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== How to use this guide

====
*Commands Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* The `add`, `edit` and `delete` commands each have a shorthand equivalent alias, and their usage can be viewed below at their respective sections in the User Guide.

=== Navigating the User Interface

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

== Task Level Features

=== Viewing Tasks of a Project

To view tasks of a project, always follow the two steps below: +
1. `listproject`: List all projects in project list. +
2. `select INDEX`: Select a project to view all the tasks within selected project.

=== Task Level Commands

Commands affecting the tasks / selected task individually. +
Affects panel D.

==== Adding a task: `add`

Adds a task to the project identified by the index number used in the displayed project list.

* Format: `add n/NAME [d/DESCRIPTION] [dl/DEADLINE] [t/TAG]`
* Alias: `a`, i.e. `add` is equivalent to `a`

[TIP]
A task can have any number of tags (including 0).

Example:

* `add n/Decide on Research Paper Topic by/01/01/2020`

Outcome: Task Box (Panel D) will show the newly created task `Decide on Research Paper Topic` with deadline `1 January 2020`.

==== Editing a task: `edit`

Edits an existing task identified by the index number used in the displayed task list.

* Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [d/DESCRIPTION] [dl/DEADLINE] [t/TAG]...`

* Alias: `e`, i.e. `edit` is equivalent to `e`

[TIP]
At least 1 among the parameters of `[n/NAME] [d/DESCRIPTION] [dl/DEADLINE] [t/TAG]` must be included within the command.

Example:

* `edit 1 n/Decide on Research Paper Topic dl/02/02/2020`

Outcome: Task Box (Panel D) will show the updated task at index 1, with the information name and deadline changed to `Decide on Research Paper Topic` and `2 February 2020` respectively.

==== Locating tasks by name: `find`

Finds a project, task or subtask whose name contains any of the given keywords.

* Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* Alias: `f`, i.e. `find` is equivalent to `f`

[TIP]
The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`. +
The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`. +
`find` will only search among names of tasks. +
Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`. +
Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`.

Examples:

* `find Research`

Outcome: Returns tasks containing the keyword `Research`. Task Box (Panel D) will be updated to display only tasks that matches the keyword.

==== Deleting a task: `delete`

Deletes the specified task identified by the index number used in the displayed task list.

* Format: `delete INDEX`

* Alias: `d`, i.e. `delete` is equivalent to `d`

[TIP]
The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list. +
The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, …

Examples:

1. `list` +
2. `delete 2`

Outcome: Task Box (Panel D) will no longer display the second task in the project.

1. `find Consult` +
2. `delete 1`

Outcome: Task Box (Panel D) will no longer display the first task in the results of the `find` command.
