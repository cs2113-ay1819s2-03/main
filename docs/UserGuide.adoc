== Introduction
Welcome to NoteNote (NN)!

If you're looking for an application to organize your projects you've come to the right place! But that's not all NoteNote can do! NoteNote can also keep track of individual tasks, analyze your productivity and share your To-Do list with your friends!

We designed the application ground up for computing students, so you can say that NoteNote is designed for computing students, by computing students, so you can be sure that it will fulfil all your project management needs!

Built for computing students, NoteNote uses minimal (GUI) elements, instead opting for a faster Command Line Interface (CLI) while maintaining the benefits of the GUI. So if you can type fast and are used to command line, NoteNote is sure to help manage your task faster than other traditional GUI based task managers.

So just head over to our <<Quick Start>> section and begin your NoteNote experience!

== How to use this guide

There are several terms which we use throughout our guide. To make your life easier, please do read the following sections to ensure that you are able to use our User Guide to the fullest extent!

=== Commands Format

The examples in this guide are formatted using the following convention:
Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME, NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Sample Task 1 t/SAMPLE` or as `n/Sample Task 1`.
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as (i.e. 0 times), `t/CS2101`, `t/SEM1` `t/SCHOOL` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME` `ds/DESCRIPTION`, `ds/DESCRIPTION` `n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* All commands each have a shorthand equivalent alias, and their usage can be viewed below at their respective sections in the User Guide.

=== Icons Meaning

== Application Overview

// tag::UIlayout[]
=== User Interface Layout

image::applayout.png[width="500", title="Application interface"]

* *Panel A: Command Box* - Where your commands will be typed
* *Panel B: Results Box* - Displays result for the following commands: history, taskhistory, compare,  listtag; else displays either success / error message for all other commands.
* *Panel C: Project Box* - Displays list of project
* *Panel D: Task Box* - Displays list of tasks for a selected project
* *Panel E: Description Box* - Displays long description for a selected task

Panel *A*, *C*, *D* are user-interactable while panels *B*, *E* are non-interactable.

Panel A will always be active, allowing you to input your commands at any time.

Upon first opening of the application, your active panel will start from *C*, and only upon choosing a project will your active panel change to *D*.
// end::UIlayout[]

=== Application Layout

image::Ui.png[width="790", title="Application layout"]

The application has two levels, the project level and the task level, as shown. There are some commands that only works on certain levels. This is covered in detail in Sections 6 and 7. The project level contains all the projects the user has added while the task level contains the tasks of a particular project.

When you are in the project level, the Project Box (Panel C) will be active and unshaded while the Task Box (Panel D) will be inactive and shaded. Similarly, when you are in the task level, the Project Box (Panel C) will be inactive and shaded and the Task Box (Panel D) will be active and unshaded.

Refer to diagrams below on what you should expect to see when you are in the respective levels.


== Quick Start


.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `notenote.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  Type the command in the command box or *Panel A* (refer to Figure 1) and press Enter to execute it.
.  Some example commands you can try:
* *`listproject`* : lists all projects
* **`select 1`** : selects the project at index 1
* **`add n/Do research on Singapore history dl/1-1-2020`** : adds a task of title “Do research on Singapore History” with a deadline set at “1st January 2020” to the project previously selected.

* *`delete 1`* : deletes the task being shown at index 1


== Project Level Features

=== Navigating Between Projects
When selecting a (different) project to the view tasks of the project, always follow the 2 steps below:

. `listproject`: List all project in project list
. `select INDEX`: Select a project to view all the tasks within selected project

=== Project Level Commands
Commands affecting the project list / currently displayed project as a whole. +
Affects Panel C.

==== Adding a project: `add`
Adds a new project to the System.

* Format: `add n/NAME`
* Alias: `a`, i.e. `add` is equivalent to `a`

[TIP]
A project can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `add n/History Research Paper`

Outcome: Project Box (Panel C) will show the newly created project.

==== Editing a project: `edit`
Edits an existing project identified by the index number used in the displayed project list.

* Format: `edit INDEX n/NAME`
* Alias: `e`, i.e. `edit` is equivalent to `e`

Examples:

* `edit 1 n/Sample Task 1`

Outcome: Project Box (Panel C) will show the updated project with the new name.

// tag::listproject[]
==== List projects: `listproject`
Command has two functions. Firstly, it lists all projects. Secondly, it is used for navigation to switch from the task
list back to the project list.

* Format: `listproject`
* Alias: `lp`, i.e. `listproject` is equivalent to `lp`

Outcome: Project Box (Panel C) will will display all projects within project list.

Selects a project identified by the index number used in the displayed project list.

* Format: `select INDEX`
* Alias: `s`, i.e. `select` is equivalent to `s`

[NOTE]
If the **immediate predecessor command** is `listproject`, `select` will select a project and display tasks, else `select` will select a task and display task information

Examples:

* `select 1`

Outcome: Task Box (Panel D) will display all tasks within selected project. Active panel is now Panel D and all commands that is executed after this would be in the context of tasks.

// tag::definetag[]
==== Defining a group tag: `definetag`

Define a group tag when you want to add multiple identical tags to multiple tasks easily. They can be carried out at both project and task level.
However, group tag created exists for the entire NoteNote instance and will be lost once the user exits.

After defining a group tag, use the `addtag` command to add a group tag to a task of your choice. Note that duplicated group tags cannot be created.

* Format: `definetag gt/GROUPTAG t/TAG [t/MORETAGS]`
* Alias: `dt`, i.e. `definetag` is equivalent to `dt`

Example:

* `definetag gt/Consultation t/PrepareDemo t/PrepareQuestions`

Outcome: A group tag called Consultation will be created which would contain tags PrepareDemo and PrepareQuestions.

image::AfterDefineTag.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
====
Group tags are only considered as duplicates in the following situations where both the group tag and child tags are identical:

** `definetag gt/sample t/TAG0`
** `definetag gt/sample t/TAG0`

In situations where users input `definetag gt/sample1 gt/sample2 t/TAG`, only the last group tag parameter (i.e. `gt/sample2`) will be accepted.

====
// end::definetag[]

// tag::import[]
==== Import a project list: `import`
Import projects and tasks to your NoteNote instance from project list shared by a friend. New projects and tasks will be added on top of current project list.

Source file must be a JSON file and follow a specific format. See <<samplejson>>.

This feature is recommended to be used together with `export` so that users need not manually generate a JSON file to `import`.

* Format: `import PATH`
* Alias: `i`, i.e. `import` is equivalent to `i`

Examples:

* `import C:\Users\Test\Desktop\import.json`

[TIP]
The full path to the JSON file has to be specified unless the file is contained within the application folder. If JSON file is contained in application folder, `import .\test.json` is sufficient.

Outcome: Command box will display number of projects added to project list. Projects and tasks contained in JSON file will be imported and added to current project list.
Refer to diagrams below on what NoteNote will display before and after successful execution of `import`.

.Before executing `import`

* Format: `export [i/INDEX] o/OUTPUTPATH`
* Alias: `ex`, i.e. `export` is equivalent to `ex`

Examples:

* To export currently selected project:
. `select 1`
. `export o/C:\Users\Test\Desktop\export.json`
* To export multiple projects:
. `export i/1,2,3 o/C:\Users\Test\Desktop\export.json`

[TIP]
Output path should be explicitly specified unless the output is to be within the application folder. If output is to be contained in application folder, the relative path `export i/1,2,3 o/.\test.json` is sufficient.

Outcome: JSON file will be created at output path specified.

.After executing `export`
image::AfterExportCommand.png[width="600"]
// end::export[]

// tag::analyse[]
==== Analyse progress of all projects: `analyse`
View number of completed tasks for each project, and percentage of each project completed.

         Allows you to view a direct comparison of what was changed.
// end::compare[]

== Future Enhancements [coming in v2.0]

==== Analyse progress of all projects: `analyse`

Current `analyse` feature will show number of completed tasks for each project, and percentage of each project completed.

Future enhancement of `analyse` will be more comprehensive, displaying *visual graphs, charts & tables*

Example :

*  `edit 1 n/edited_name` ...

Outcome: Task Box (Panel D) will update the name for the task at index 1 to reflect the new edited name.

*  `undotask 1`

Outcome: Task Box (Panel D) will update the name for the task at index 1 to reflect the previous name before the edit.

==== Redo per task `redotask`

Current `redo` feature is a general execution on the overall undo command that is executed.

`redotask` will allow you to "redo" from a `undotask` that is executed on the selected task.

* Format: `redotask INDEX`

Example :

*  `undotask 1`

Outcome: Task Box (Panel D) will update the name for the task at index 1 to reflect the previous name before the edit.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another computer? +
*A*: Data can be transferred between computers by simply porting over the *_projectlist.json_* file located at the *_data_* folder. Alternatively, you could:

. `export` project list from the original computer
. Install NoteNote in the other computer
. `import` project list by specifying path to exported project list
