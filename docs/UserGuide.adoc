== Introduction
NoteNote (NN), is a desktop project management system for Computing students to keep track of multiple projects and their corresponding tasks. More importantly, NN is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, NN can help you to manage your tasks faster than traditional GUI apps. Have we caught your interest? Jump to  <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== How to use this guide

=== Commands Format

The examples in this guide are formatted using the following convention:
Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME, NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend` `t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME` `p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER` `n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* The `add`, `edit` and `delete` commands each have a shorthand equivalent alias, and their usage can be viewed below at their respective sections in the User Guide.


== Application Overview

=== Application Layout

image::apporg.png[width="790"]

The application has two layers, the project layer and the task layer, as shown in Figure 1 above. There are some commands which work differently based on the layer they are in. This is covered in detail in Sections 6 and 7. The project layer contains all the projects the user has added while the task layer contains the tasks and subtasks assigned to a particular project.

=== User Interface Layout

image::applayout.png[width="790"]

* *Panel A: Command Box* - Where your commands will be typed
* *Panel B: Results Box* - Displays result for the following commands: history, taskhistory, compare,  listtag; else displays either success / error message for all other commands.
* *Panel C: Project Box* - Displays list of project
* *Panel D: Task Box* - Displays list of tasks for a selected project
* *Panel E: Description Box* - Displays long description for a selected task

=== Navigating the User Interface

Panel *A*, *C*, *D* are user-interactable while panels *B*, *E* are non-interactable.
Panel A will always be active, allowing you to input your commands at any time
Upon first opening of the application, your active panel will start from *C*, and only upon choosing a project will your active panel change to *D*.


== Quick Start


.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  Type the command in the command box or *Panel A* (refer to Figure 2) and press Enter to execute it.
.  Some example commands you can try:
* *`listproject`* : lists all projects
* **`select 1`** : selects the project at index 1
* **`add n/Do research on Singapore history dl/1-1-2020`** : adds a task of title “Do research on Singapore History” with a deadline set at “1st January 2020” to the project previously selected.

* *`delete 1`* : deletes the task being shown at index 1


== Project Level Features
