== PROJECT: NoteNote

---

== Overview

NoteNote is a desktop project application allowing you to manage multiple projects and tasks. You will interact with it through a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

My main contributions to NoteNote is the implementation of 2 of my features, `taskhistory` and `compare`.
I have also contributed to the team by helping manage version releases and ensuring deliverables are met.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to view command history for each individual task*
** *What it does*: allows you to view a command history of a chosen task with the command `taskhistory`. The command history will include commands that have a direct impact on the task (e.g. `edit` / `completed` / `addtag` / `delete`)

** *Justification*: Current implementation will only allow you to view the command history of every command (valid & invalid) that has been entered.
But when handling multiple large projects, a user is bound to have numerous edits for the many task that is there.
In this case the likelihood of a user forgetting / executing a wrong command is very probable. Thus, this feature allows a user
to view a record of the changes he made for a specific task instead of viewing it as a whole project. Allowing easy referencing for a user.
** *Highlights*: This feature is implemented by creating another stack parallel to the existing command history stack. This new stack will contain the unique ID of a task corresponding
to the command of the same index in the command history.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *the ability to compare a task to its previous version*
** *What it does*: allows you to view a direct comparison of a chosen task against its previous version before the edit with the command `compare`
** *Justification*: To allow easy referencing for a chosen task in a neater method as this feature compares the differences and will only show you the result of the field (Name / Description / Deadline) that was changed, instead of all the fields.
** *Highlights*: Current `undo` feature is implemented as general undo for all commands.
This `compare` feature serves as a base for a future feature which allows `undo` for a specific task.
 ***   You will be able to `undo` to the version that is shown when `compare` executes.
