== PROJECT: NoteNote

---

== Overview

*NoteNote* is a project management tool created for Computing students to organize multiple projects and tasks effectively through the Command Line Interface (CLI).

Other than keeping track of your projects and tasks, NoteNote also allows you to analyze your productivity, categorize your tasks, share tasks with you friends and many more.

== Summary of contributions
My contributions to NoteNote consists of the implementation of the `import` and `export` feature and
the refactoring required to morph the original AddressBook 4 application to NoteNote.

* *Enhancement 1: added the ability to import and export projects*
** What it does:
*** `import`: Imports new projects from a JSON file
*** `export`: Exports selected projects to a JSON file
** Justification: This feature allows you to easily share projects with another user without having to manually enter projects and tasks using the CLI.
** Highlights: The implementation was challenging as it requires us to familiarize ourselves with the existing implementation of the Storage component and tweak it to support NoteNote's storage requirement. +
Furthermore, we also had to understand the utilities (e.g. `FileUtil`, `JsonUtil`) that the Storage component relies on so as to take advantage of these utilities to implement `import` and `export`.

* *Enhancement 2: modified UI, Logic, Model and Storage components for NoteNote*
** What it does:
*** *UI* would now display an additional panel to show list of projects
*** *Logic* is tweaked to load project list upon start up and associate projects with their tasks to allow navigation between projects and tasks.
*** Introduce new classes in *Model* to support implementation of Project List, Project and Task.
*** *Storage* is modified to keep track of multiple tasks within a project and multiple projects within a project list
** Justification: The current implementation of AddressBook is unable to support all the functions of NoteNote and requires us to heavily morph the existing AddressBook application.
** Highlights: The implementation was challenging as it requires us to understand the implementation of all the above-mentioned components and modify them simultaneously in order to verify that modification is done correctly.
