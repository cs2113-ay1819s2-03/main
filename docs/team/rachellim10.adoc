== PROJECT: NoteNote

---

== Overview

NoteNote is a desktop project application used for managing multiple projects and tasks (refer to Figure 1). +
It is convenient and easy to use as the user just needs to type one-liner commands (using a Command Line Interface). +
Besides adding projects and tasks, users can also organise them with different tags of their choice, and track their progress along the way as well. +
This application was developed by my other four team members and I for CS2113T, an NUS module.

== Summary of contributions

|===
|_This section contains the breakdown of my contributions to this application._
|===

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to mark tasks as completed*
** What it does: It allows the user to mark specific tasks as completed by displaying a `completed` tag for each of those tasks (refer to Figure 2).
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can conveniently check off tasks that are completed, which ties in with the main purpose of this application, i.e. task management.
** Highlights: This enhancement required a different implementation from `edit` as it was more specialised and only affected the tags of a task. Any tasks marked as completed would also have to be retained in Storage, to complement the `analyse` feature.

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to analyse all completed tasks*
** What it does: It allows the user to see at one glance how many tasks in each project have been completed, as well as the percentage completed for each project (refer to Figure 3).
** Justification: This feature allows the user to effortlessly track their progress across multiple projects by displaying clear and easily understood statistics.
** Highlights: This enhancement required additional implementations as the current `find` command could only search through names of tasks, but `analyse` needed to search through tags instead and present the results as a countable statistic.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added *command aliases* that allow the user to *cut down the amount of typing* to execute any command (refer to Figure 4).
