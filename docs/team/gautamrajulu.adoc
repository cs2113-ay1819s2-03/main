== Summary of contributions
I contributed to the development of NoteNote via two functions, sortDeadline and list.

* *Major enhancement*: added the *sortDeadline command*
** What it does: the sortDeadline command helps to sort the tasks in the current project according to when they are due
** Justification: This allows the task which is due the soonest to be displayed first, allowing the user to focus on said task
** Highlights: This enhancement removed then repopulated the entire list of task and thus had some danger of affecting other code. Hence measures had to  be taken to ensure that other parts fot he application would not be affected

* *Minor enhancement*: improved the `list command` to allow it to work on both the task level and the project level. Also added a `listprojects` command which navigated to the project list from the task list.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_
